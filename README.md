## staircaseproblem.py has the below problem.
There's a staircase with N steps, and you can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of      unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:


         1, 1, 1, 1

         2, 1, 1
         
         1, 2, 1
         
         1, 1, 2
         
         2, 2

What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time. Generalize your function to take in X.

## ListHasNumberPair.py
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.
